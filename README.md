# Queens College Scheduler SQL Project
- Worked with a group of peers who each had a task on working with SQL databases.
- Utilized Subqueries and Joins tables to differentiate the levels simple, medium, and complex tables while optimizing a stored procedure.
- Wrote 15+ SQL queries to obtain data from multiple tables and extract into each data schema.
